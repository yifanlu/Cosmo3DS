# Cosmo3DS

This is a stripped down version of [AuReiNand](https://github.com/AuroraWright/AuReiNand) 
that does nothing but load FIRM and emuNAND.

It is intended to be used with [3ds_injector](https://github.com/yifanlu/3ds_injector) 
to launch a modified `loader` in FIRM.

## Why not just AuReiNand?

This adds no features to AuReiNand and in fact removes many features. This is 
because I believe in simplicity and I believe in keeping features of code 
integrity in the system intact. The name change is a result of this change in 
philosophy. I understand that not everyone agrees with this so they are always 
free to use AuReiNand instead.

## Build
